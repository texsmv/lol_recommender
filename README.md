## Team recommender for MOBA games using collaborative filter (using LOL dataset)

We implemented a memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm on cuda to allow real time queries on big datasets.

Our proposal includes a sparse representation of the matrix of items, the use of red-black trees to allow instant data updates, as well as the use of the computational power of the GPU to make recommendations in real time.
